# mutt

Mutt is an email client for the terminal, which is insanely fast (thanks to
only having A TUI), has excellent support for pipes and GPG, and is extremely
versatile. I use it simply as an email *viewer*, and let other programs like
[msmtp](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/msmtp) and
[offlineimap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OfflineIMAP) handle the
actual transactions of the files.

`msmtp` and `OfflineIMAP`'s configuration files are encrypted, as I view them
to be somewhat more sensitive in nature. Feel free to send me an email if you
want a redacted copy as an example for your own configuration.
