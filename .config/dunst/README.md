# dunst

Dunst is a notification server for Linux. It takes events from `libnotify` and
shell commands like `notify-send` (usually bundled with libnotify in your
package manager) to show a notification on the screen.

The `dunst` executable needs to run as a daemon for this to work.

I need this because I roll a simple window manager with no native notification
system!
