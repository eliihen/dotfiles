# Dotfiles

Hi! These are my dotfiles that I use every day. If you find something
interesting, go ahead and take whatever you want from my dotfiles.

You probably don't want to run my install scripts, those are for my own use. But
feel free if you want.

# Requirements for install scripts

Requirements for pretty much everything

    git nodejs npm

The requirements i3 wm I use are

    i3 i3blocks playerctl sysstat

The requirements for vim is the following (Mostly because we need to compile
YCM)

    vim automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel cmake python-devel
    python3-devel

Requirements for zsh

    zsh rubygems
